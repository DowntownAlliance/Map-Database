# Downtown Alliance Placemaking Map Database

Welcome to the Downtown Alliance Placemaking Team's Map Database GitHub Page! This project provides a map interface showcasing all the public spaces identified by the Placemaking Team for potential activations in downtown New York City. The map not only displays the team's gathered data but also overlays various public datasets from NYC OpenData to enrich the information.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to create an interactive map that aids the Downtown Alliance's Placemaking Team in identifying suitable locations for community activations and events. By integrating multiple data sources, including live updates from city APIs and Google Sheets, the map database offers a dynamic and constantly updated view of the public spaces landscape in downtown NYC.

### Technologies Used

- **Mapbox**: The map interface is built using Mapbox, allowing for custom map styling and interactive features.
- **NYC OpenData API**: Public datasets from NYC OpenData are integrated to provide additional insights into city infrastructure and amenities.
- **Google Sheets**: Certain data is managed and updated via Google Sheets, ensuring seamless collaboration and data synchronization.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Explore and navigate through downtown NYC's public spaces with ease.
- **Live Data**: Majority of the data on the site is live and will update automatically if changes occur in the source data.
- **Data Layers**: Overlay various datasets such as POPS, landmarks/sites, and location of active construction scaffolding.
- **Information Tabs**: Learn more about the data sources and methodologies used in the 'Data' tab.
